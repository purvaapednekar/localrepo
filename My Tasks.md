Perfect! 🚀 You're going all in with a **Full Stack Java + DSA** roadmap? That’s a solid combo—**DSA for cracking interviews**, and **Full Stack Java** for building real-world applications.

Let’s break this into two major tracks:

---

## 🧠 Track 1: **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**  
This is your "get hired" weapon—focus on **problem-solving**, coding patterns, and system thinking.

### 📌 Phase 1: Basics
- [ ] Time & Space Complexity (Big O)
- [ ] Arrays & Strings
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- [ ] Recursion & Backtracking

### 📌 Phase 2: Core Data Structures
- [ ] Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- [ ]Stacks & Queues
- [ ] Trees (Binary Tree, BST, Trie)
- [ ]Heaps (Min/Max)
- [ ] Graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find)

### 📌 Phase 3: Algorithms
- [ ] Searching & Binary Search
- [ ]Greedy Algorithms
- [ ] Dynamic Programming
- [ ] Sliding Window & Two Pointers
- [ ] Bit Manipulation

### 🎯 Tools & Practice
- LeetCode / Codeforces / GFG
- Java-specific practice on [Coding Ninjas](https://www.codingninjas.com/)
- Track progress in a `dsa.md` or GitHub repo

## 💻 Track 2: **Full Stack Java Development**
This is your "build real stuff" skillset—frontend to backend, with Java as the powerhouse.

### 📌 Phase 1: Java Core (You may already know this)
- [x] Introduction to java
- [x] Flowcharts and pseudo code
- [x] Installation and Architecture of Java
- [ ] Conditional Satements and loops
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] OOP Concepts
- [ ] Collections (List, Map, Set)
- [ ] Exception Handling
- [ ] File I/O
- [ ] Java 8 Features (Streams, Lambdas, Optional)
  

---

### 📌 Phase 2: Backend Development (Spring Boot)
- [ ] Spring Boot basics (REST APIs)
- [ ] JDBC
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Spring Data JPA + Hibernate
- [ ] Database: MySQL / PostgreSQL
- [ ] Validation & Exception Handling
- [ ] Testing with JUnit + Mockito
- [ ] Build tool: Maven or Gradle

---

### 📌 Phase 3: Frontend Basics
Choose **React** or **basic HTML/CSS/JS** first.

- [ ] HTML/CSS + Bootstrap
- [ ] JavaScript (ES6+)
- [ ] React.js (Components, State, Props, Routing)
- [ ] Axios/Fetch for API calls
- [ ] Form handling and validations

---

### 📌 Phase 4: Full Stack Integration
- [ ] Build frontend → connect to Spring Boot backend via REST APIs
- [ ] Use JSON for data exchange
- [ ] Add login/auth (JWT-based auth in Spring Security)

---

### 📌 Phase 5: DevOps & Deployment
- [x] Git & GitHub
- [ ] Docker basics (for containerizing apps)
- ✅ Deploy on:
  - **Render / Vercel** (for frontend)
  - **Heroku / Railway / AWS EC2** (for backend)

---

## 🛠 Tools to Use
| Purpose          | Tool           |
|------------------|----------------|
| IDE              | IntelliJ / VS Code |
| API testing      | Postman        |
| DB client        | MySQL Workbench / DBeaver |
| Version control  | Git + GitHub   |
| Project mgmt     | GitHub Projects / Notion |

---

## ✅ Bonus: Real-World Projects to Build
- 📝 Task Manager (Full stack CRUD)
- 📦 E-commerce API (Product, Cart, Checkout)
- 🔐 Login + JWT Auth System
- 🌐 Personal Portfolio with contact form
- 📊 Expense Tracker (with graphs/charts)
