## üß† **Python + Data Science Roadmap** (2024‚Äì2025)

---

### üî∞ **Stage 1: Python Fundamentals**

Before diving into data, get really comfortable with Python basics.

#### Key Concepts:
- Variables, Data Types, Lists, Dicts, Tuples
- Loops, Conditionals
- Functions, *args/**kwargs
- File I/O
- Error Handling
- Virtual Environments (`venv`, `pip`)
- OOP Basics (classes, inheritance)

#### Tools:
- [ ] Python 3.10+
- [ ] VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] Git + GitHub

---

### üìä **Stage 2: Python for Data Analysis**

Start working with real data using Python's core data science libraries.

#### Learn:
- **NumPy**: Arrays, vectorized ops, broadcasting
- **Pandas**: DataFrames, filtering, aggregation, merging
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Plotly** (for interactive graphs)

#### Projects:
- Analyze a CSV dataset (e.g., Titanic, Netflix)
- Create visualizations: bar charts, heatmaps, histograms

---

### üìà **Stage 3: Statistics & Math for Data Science**

You don't need to be a math genius, but some concepts are essential.

#### Focus On:
- Descriptive Stats (mean, median, std dev)
- Probability & Distributions
- Hypothesis Testing
- Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices)
- Calculus (for ML, just intuition is enough)
- Correlation vs Causation

---

### üß™ **Stage 4: Data Wrangling & Cleaning**

Real-world data is messy ‚Äî learn how to clean and prepare it.

#### Topics:
- Handling nulls, duplicates
- Data types conversion
- Feature engineering
- Date/time parsing
- Web scraping (with `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`)
- APIs (with `requests`)

---

### ü§ñ **Stage 5: Machine Learning (ML)**

Start building smart models using **scikit-learn**.

#### Learn:
- ML Basics: Supervised vs Unsupervised
- Algorithms:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - KNN
  - Clustering (K-Means)
  - Random Forests
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC

#### Libraries:
- [ ] `scikit-learn`
- [ ] `xgboost` (for advanced ML)
- [ ] `imbalanced-learn` (for skewed data)

---

### üì¶ **Stage 6: Deep Learning (Optional/Advanced)**

If you're interested in AI/Neural Networks:

#### Learn:
- **Neural networks**, activation functions
- Image recognition, NLP basics

#### Libraries:
- [ ] **TensorFlow** / **PyTorch**
- [ ] **Keras**
- [ ] **OpenCV** (for image data)

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Stage 7: Tools & Ecosystem**

#### Data Tools:
- [ ] **Jupyter Notebooks**
- [ ] **Google Colab**
- [ ] **Docker** (for packaging models)
- [ ] **MLflow** (for model tracking)

#### Cloud Platforms:
- [ ] AWS (S3, SageMaker)
- [ ] GCP (BigQuery, Vertex AI)
- [ ] Azure ML

---

### üéì **Stage 8: Real Projects & Portfolio**

Apply what you‚Äôve learned in real projects:

#### Ideas:
- Predict housing prices (regression)
- Sentiment analysis on tweets (NLP)
- Customer churn prediction
- Build a recommendation engine
- Create a dashboard (with Plotly Dash or Streamlit)

---

### ‚úÖ **Bonus Tips:**

- Use **Kaggle** to practice datasets & competitions
- Build a GitHub portfolio with projects
- Document your process in Jupyter / Markdown
- Write blog posts (optional but helpful)
